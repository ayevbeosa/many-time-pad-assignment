# many-time-pad-assignment

## Problem
Try to recover the plaintexts of all messages, as well as the encryption key used for them. More details [here](https://github.com/Polkadot-Blockchain-Academy/pba-content/blob/main/syllabus/1-Cryptography/materials/many-time-pad.md)

## Thought Process
* Convert the plaintext of the message from hex to bytes
* XOR each byte with randomly guessed words till the results begin to make sense.
